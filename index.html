      My journey into coding happened "accidentally.<br>I will always be grateful to my husband's lecturer for introducing me to it. <br>I am so appreciative of her kindness for sharing information about this wondefrul opportunity<br>Hence, just as in the movie "pay it Foward, I will endeavour to do the same!!!

        About me
      </h1>

      <p>
        How did I get into coding you may ask? Definitely not because I had a lot of free time on my hands, but actually just the opposite! I remember saying to myself, "are you mad?", knowing that I was already experiencing burn-out and coupled with that, I was struggling with my current research project. Despite the aforementioned though, I decided to "give it a go". <br><br> I had to ask myself why would someone, already under so much pressure, ie: work, family, studies and other, want to put herself under even more "strain". The answer was easy, simple and very clear...I needed to make a change for my own future, since all the doors I've knocked on to date, were not opening, I was prepared to take one more leap of faith. <br><br> As it turns out, I found that I actually really enjoyed the excercises I needed to complete in grasshopper and was excited to start with step 2, where I was introduced to freecodecamp; I enjoyed EVERY excercise I completed. I am presently busy on another platform called codepen. What I found truly amazing was my brain's ability to adapt, stretch, grow. The more I learnt, the more I wanted to learn. The more I understood what was required of me, the less time I spent on specific instructions. One thing I need to remind myself of though, was to "slow down and read first", NOT "just do". I was a mediocre student at school, yet now I am able to not only read but write code (infant stage off course), but I am doing it! So if someone had told me a year ago that I would be "coding" and enjoying it, I would never have believed it. Yet, here I am and loving every minute. <br><br> I was so excited for the amazing learning opportunity afforded me by the CodeYourFuture team in Cape Town. It feels like I've been given a new lease on life...so grateful:-). I want to learn how to use code so I can help others like me who may not have believed that "we would ever amount to anything". I hope my journey inspires others to take a "leaf out of my book" and take the plunge to try out coding. I know it will change their outlook on life in general, just as it did for me.
